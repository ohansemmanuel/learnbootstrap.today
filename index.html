		<h2>Another book?</h2>
		<h4>We seriously don't need one</h4>

		<p>
			...But there is a problem with the way we've always written CSS layouts. <i class="em em-grin"></i>
		</p>

		<p>
			If you ever struggled with table display hacks, or floats &amp; their pain, you already know this.
		</p>
		<p>
			Imagine a future where you didnt have to do all that. The future is now - it's 2017.

		<p>
			<a href="">CSS Flexbox</a> and <a href="">Grids</a> are here to stay. They define the new standards. They are everyone's dream. Or should be :-)
		</p>

		<p>
			Clean codes, less hacks, more productivity <i class="em em-100"></i>

		<h2>Do we get all this sweetness for free?</h2>
		<h4>They say the best things are free. Maybe not this. <i class="em em-joy"></i></h4>

			<p>
				Flexbox and Grids are completely different from what we've always done.
			</p>
			<p>
				With great powers come great responsibility. It's the same with this.
			</p>

			<p>
				Understanding Flexbox and Grids take a complete reworking of what you already know.
			</p>

			<p>New syntax, new mental models.</p>

			<p>
				It may not be difficult for you, but it really is for most of us. Super confusing at times.

			<h2>So why am I writing this book?</h2>
			<h4>crazy me</h4>

			<p>I am trying to reach for the skies on this one.</p>

			<p>I said to myself, "Emmanuel, write a book that's complete in itself and like nothing else out there". Hell Yeah!</p>

			<p>Oh, and that was after struggling with wrapping my head around the whole "Flex" and "Grid" thing.</p>
			<p>Is the book really going to be like nothing else out there? </p>

			<p> Well, be the judge of that <i class="em em-grinning"></i><i class="em em-grinning"></i></p>
